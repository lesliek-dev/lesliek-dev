## About Me
Former healthcare worker, now working as a public servant.
Firm believer in the right to privacy and right to repair.
Interested in getting more involved in contributing to open source as I strongly object to the dependence our modern society has on big tech companies and the pervasive effect that has had on many facets of our day to day lives.
